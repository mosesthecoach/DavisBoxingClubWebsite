        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Davis Boxing Club was founded on Omaha grit and a belief that boxing can
          unlock purpose for young people and families who need it most.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why We Started</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          From neighborhood garages to a thriving community space, Davis Boxing
          Club began as a promise: provide a safe, disciplined environment where
          youth can feel seen, supported, and challenged to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founder Eric Hurley saw firsthand how boxing teaches more than footwork
          and jabs. It instills respect, sharpens awareness, and creates a sense
          of belonging. With roots deep in North Omaha, the club now serves youth
          and adults across the city, offering mentorship, academic support, and
          a healthy outlet when life gets heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, every class is about more than training. It’s about building
          resilient leaders ready to champion their communities.
